Usage
-------

![Spotlight](http://i.imgur.com/7SVdJE1.png) Activate this when you activate the spotlight on OkCupid. The extension will monitor the people OkC shows your profile to and report back with details about them. The gathered profile data is cleared once you exit your browser so be sure to take note of your special data points!

![Inbox](http://i.imgur.com/YVsl1jC.png) Does your inbox get flooded with messages? You can now quickly and easily filter your inbox to check for potential matches before scouring your inbox for “the one”. This goes above and beyond the current filters OkC offers.

![Search](http://i.imgur.com/v2MkfVQ.png) Use the existing Browse Matches functionality on OkCupid and narrow down your prefered match preferences. When you have your criteria in place simply click on this icon in the extension to import your search. You’ll be able to further filter your matches by match vs friend percentage, contacts this week and reply percent. Don’t get lost in the numbers!

![Visitors](http://i.imgur.com/NZsivTo.png) Constantly get visited but don’t have time to go through everyone? Maybe your perfect match decided not to leave you a message. Use the visitor checker to filter through who’s checking you out.
